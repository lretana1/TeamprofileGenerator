  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

 This project makes it easy to create a webpage to quickly display team member information saving time.

 The app asks the user a series a questions based on whether the team member is an intern, engineer or manager. Each category shares similar questions but will prompt an engineer to enter their github username, an intern their school and a manager their phone number
