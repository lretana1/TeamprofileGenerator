  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

  Below I have provided a download link to the project for ease of access. The file may either be cloned down to a particular directory or a zip version of the project is also made available. Next you'll want to open up the file through a text editor for the next step. Move into the root directory of the project "TeamProfileGenerator". All the prerequisites have been been met are youre just about ready to open the app.
